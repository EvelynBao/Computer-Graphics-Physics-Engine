Ruyi Bao

================

I calculated the force and acceleration from three types of springs, collision and force field as required.

I also implemented the following extra credit:

1. drew a prettier blue cube
2. realized an inclined green plane and did collision detection and force on it
3. did a interactive mode, which allow users to use mouse left button to drag the cube and apply force on it. press 'M' to a front position for better demonstration
4. added a simple pink skybox
